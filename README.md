  ### Trailer: GTA VI
  
In this project, we edited the audio of the GTA VI trailer, which is an action-adventure game, to change the genre of the trailer. Using the editing software Audacity, we incorporated sound effects such as impacts and ambient sounds to highlight important moments and add a natural feel at the beginning of the trailer. These audio files were obtained from the internet.

We inserted a transition between the original background music and a dark, cinematic score to shift the mood from normal and calm to tense and scary. This transition was created using effects and filters in Audacity that allowed us to modify speed, tempo, pitch, and volume.

A narrator's voice introduces a malignant entity that completely disrupts the balance of the city, helping to explain the situation and set the scene. This voice was generated by AI using the site app.fliki.ai. Additionally, human voices were added to emphasize the presence of the malignant entity. These were distorted using low-pass filters (LPF) and amplifiers to achieve a monster-like effect.

Some original dialogues were kept in the new soundtrack using OpenVINO AI effects to separate the voices from the instrumentals.
